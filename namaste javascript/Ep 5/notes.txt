window is a global object which is cretaed along with the global execution context when a web page is loaded. Even if the file is empty.
window object is used to access the variables and functions present in the memory component of global execution context or global scope.
it also provides 'this' keyword which is used to reference this window object. i.e. this === window

for example:

var a = 10;

function random(){
    var x = 2;
}

console.log(window.a)
//so here, 'a' is present in the window object but not 'x' since 'x' is not in the global space but in the execution context of function 'random'.

window object also provides varios inbuilt functions such as setTimeOut() and all.


Polished notes by chat gpt:

The window object serves as a global object that's created automatically when a web page is loaded, even if the file is empty. It is an essential component of the global execution context and represents the memory component of this context.

One notable feature of the window object is that it provides the this keyword, which refers to the window object itself. In other words, this === window.

Variables and functions declared in the global scope become properties and methods of the window object. For instance:

var a = 10;

function random() {
    var x = 2;
}

console.log(window.a);
// Here, 'a' is accessible as 'window.a,' but 'x' is not because 'x' exists within the execution context of the 'random' function.
Additionally, the window object offers various built-in functions, such as setTimeout().
